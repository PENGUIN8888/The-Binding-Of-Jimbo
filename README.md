### What is this mod?
The Binding Of Jimbo is a feature-rich mod for the award-winning poker rogue-like Balatro that brings 50+ new jokers, cards, and mechanics directly inspired and based on the hit indie classic The Binding of Isaac! The mod is in its early access state at the current moment, but gets updated frequently, and anything released on this repository have been thoroughly tested to make sure that they work.

If you plan on playing this mod on stream or in a video, we have assets to use for your stream thumbnails and such available in the ["graphic assets"](https://github.com/h3llo-wor1d/The-Binding-Of-Jimbo/tree/main/graphic-assets) folder! Please have fun, and happy min-maxing!
